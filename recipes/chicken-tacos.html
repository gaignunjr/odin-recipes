                Chicken Tacos

                These tacos are super simple in the fact that they are only made
                with some chicken meat (that is super delicious and full of flavor)
                and a simple onion and cilantro topping on corn tortillas. Give the
                whole thing a squeeze of lime before you eat them, and that's a 
                wrap! I feel like keeping them simple is what makes them taste like
                they are straight off of a food truck (you might also call them a 
                street taco), because you'll just pick them up and eat two. They 
                aren't fussy, they don't have a lot of layers, and they are so full 
                of flavor. You could add a bit of avocado or a sprinkle of cotija 
                cheese, but those aren't really needed. Keep it simple, friends!

                        <li> pound boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>

                        <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>                            
                        <li> ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                        <li> Juice of 2 limes</li>
                        <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil</li> 
                    </ul>
                <h4>
                    FOR THE TOPPING:
                </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> ⅓ cup finely chopped red or sweet onion</li>
                        <li> ⅓ cup finely chopped cilantro</li>
                        <li> 1 finely chopped jalapeño</li>
                        <li> Juice of 1 lime</li>
                        <li> Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                        <li> 1 lime, cut into 8 pieces</li>
                        <li> 16 small corn tortillas for serving</li>
                    </ul>
                <h5>
                    INSTRUCTIONS
                </h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li> In a large zipper-topped plastic baggie or in shallow 
                            dish, add the chicken, all of the spices, lime juice, 
                            and oil. Close the bag and use your hands to mix 
                            everything together. If you are using a shallow dish, 
                            use tongs to work the spices evenly into the chicken. 
                            You can let this rest for up to a half-hour or work 
                            with it right away. I like to let it rest a minute to 
                            increase the flavor.</li>
                        <li> Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. 
                            When the skillet is hot, add a tablespoon of oil to the 
                            pan and then add the chicken. Cook for 12 to 14 minutes, 
                            turning once, until the chicken is cooked through. 
                            Remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for 
                            10 minutes. If you have an extra-large chicken thigh, 
                            you'll need to cook them longer, so turn down the heat 
                            to medium and cook them until no longer pink (could 
                            take up to 25 minutes or 12 minutes per side).</li>
                        <li> While the chicken cooks, stir together the chicken taco 
                            topping by placing the chopped onion, cilantro, jalapeño, 
                            and the juice of one lime in a small bowl. Add salt and 
                            pepper, and stir to combine.</li>
                        <li> While the chicken rests, wipe your skillet clean with a 
                            warm rag or paper towels, and place the skillet back on 
                            the heat over medium-high to high heat. Place two tortillas 
                            (still stacked together) on the skillet and cook until 
                            the underside starts to char. Flip over and cook the 
                            other side (so the middle of each tortilla won't be cooked 
                            against the skillet but it will get warm all the way though). 
                            Repeat with remaining tortillas.</li>
                        <li> Chop the rested chicken into bite-sized pieces.</li> 
                        <li> To serve, place ⅛ of the chopped chicken in each set of 
                            tortillas (still two stacked together) and top with ⅛ of your 
                            onion mixture. Serve each taco with a wedge of lime to 
                            squeeze over the taco just before serving.</li>
